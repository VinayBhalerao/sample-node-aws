This tutorial is a sample IDP developed by 3scale to give you a look and feel how an Identity provider connects and exchanges messages between

1. Google Playground - Client Application
2. Identity provider - Developed in node.js and mongoDB as database to store the user credentials
3. Nginx - Authorization endpoints 
4. Redis server - To store the access_tokens
5. 3scale - Authorization backend for validating the tokens and generating the client_id and client_secret

##Prerequisites
1. Install node with version v0.10.29 or higher
2. Install MongoDB on localhost or use the [Modulis.io](https://modulus.io/)to create MongoDB setup online. After installation, edit the config/database.js with the mongoDB url
`mongodb://<user>:<pass>@mongo.onmodulus.net:27017/Mikha4ot`, if Modulus.io is used to create DB

`mongodb://127.0.0.1/mydb`, if localhost is used to create setup
